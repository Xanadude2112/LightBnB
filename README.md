# LightBnB Project

LightBnB is a simple, multi-page Airbnb clone that focuses mainly on the use of SQL for storing data in a database. Other languages and packages used here are JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS just to name a few.

On this site, you can find an extremely simple design as it was not intended to have a lot of styling upon its creation; however, it can still pass as a decent experience. You can simulate (almost) all the things you can do on Airbnb

- You can sign and login.

- You can create listings and view all your current listings.

- You can view your reservations linked to your account.

- And of course you can browse for propertis via a filtered search.
